The submission can be accessed on Google Colaboratory using the links given below:

Part - 2: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uFTm-u8WPRGGZrrRTcdtUN0LJXmiNgpx?usp=sharing

I have also attached the Jupiter Notebook files for the second part with the submission.

For any reasons you cannot use the Google Colaboratory or Jupiter Notebook there is need to run the .py files, make sure you have installed the following libraries on your system:

1) Numpy (https://numpy.org/install/)
2) Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html)
3) Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html)

In the .py files, The plots might not show since they were generated on Google Colaboratory. If they are needed, I have attached them separately. Or you may run the Jupiter notebook file to see them.
